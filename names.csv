"[{'author': 'Mariel L.', 'description': ""It's been a while since the Little Szechuan in SLP closed, and I still shed a small tear every time I watch a movie at Showplace and come out to the West End missing my Little Szechuan. Thank goodness their OG location is still serving consistently good food with pretty much the same menu, and actually closer to where I live now. But not close enough that it'd spell trouble because I would constantly eat there. Parking can be a bit difficult, but then again you are in Dinkytown. They have the general dining area as well as private rooms, which now that I think about it is where I always get seated. Probably coz we always bring a group in; the more dishes to enjoy, my dear. Even though everything is family-style and we know we could share a few dishes, that doesn't stop us from ordering an entree for each person and then sharing it via the genius Lazy Susan. Plus 2 plates of the Szechuan fries. And sometimes dessert. And maybe some drinks. \n\nAt this point we don't really need a menu anymore because we already know what we want. Always get the Mala fish fillet with tofu for that face-melting-but-totally-addicting spicy experience. For something much less spicy but no less delicious, get the quick fried crispy fish. Pea tips are a delicacy, so we always get that if it's in season, plus a plate of dry saut√©ed green beans. Their veggie dishes are so good, even I, lover of meat and loather of vegetables, order their eggplant in garlic sauce. It's got a little sweetness, a little heat, and hella garlicky. But don't get too concerned -- of course I still get my meat. 100% of the time, I will get either the addictively crunchy diced chicken and/or the chung king chili chicken. I've yet to try their pork or beef dishes, but I have a strong feeling I'll be back here pretty soon. I just need to remind myself to try new dishes, because when you get consistently good food, like they say, if it ain't broke why fix it?"", 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 4}, 'datePublished': '2017-08-24'}, {'author': 'Linli F.', 'description': 'Forget this being just a ""typical Chinese restaurant"" -- this place is literally SO good. If you love spicy foods, then this is most definitely somewhere you need to try. Their food comes out scorching hot, fresh, and consistent every single time and everything I\'ve tried here is so, so good.\n\nMy favorite dish here has got to be the diced fish with chili peppers. The texture of the fish is soft and tender, and the mix of flavors and spice is a mouthful of goodness. I recently tried the spicy beef noodle soup too and was surprisingly overly satisfied with it. The broth was an amazing burst of flavors with a mix of cilantro, bok choy, fresh noodles and tender cooked beef. Definitely an improvement from some of the other more watered-down beef noodle soup dishes offered at other restaurants around campus. Other things I\'ve tried that are also delicious is the eggplant with garlic sauce, Szechuan spicy fish fillet (water-boiled fish), pork shreds with dried tofu, Szechuan spicy fried tofu, ma po tofu, just to name a few. You really can\'t go wrong with anything here. If you\'re looking to try a myriad of dishes for a cheaper price, stop by for their lunch buffet on weekdays. You get to try 3 of their more popular dishes for around $10.\n\nThe only thing I\'ve noticed that I don\'t necessarily like about this place is they tend to usher or rush you out during their busy times by constantly hovering your table or looking at your group from far away, etc. I guess, understandable, since they need more tables but it\'d be nice if they were a little more discreet about it.

We had previously been to the Little Szechuan restaurant in the West End, and hadn\'t known there were other similar locations. We had the following: Eggplant in Brown Bean Sauce, Szechuan Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chicken Fried Rice. After studying abroad in Beijing, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Eggplant and beef, so was very excited to see that they offered those. The four dishes were each quite large and shareable. We even had a TON left over to take home for meals in the following days. The eggplant and beef tasted just like they do in China. I\'m not a huge fan of sesame chicken, but my friend is, and she thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was great--they kept our waters full and were attentive and responsive.

I wish they were a bit more spicy though. The wings were a good size and they were moist and delicious.\n\nDan Dan noodles - they were quite bland and missing a lot.

I've had mushroom broccoli (very good), ma po tofu (my fav), and spicy garlic seaweed (delicious and quite spicy).\n\nThe food is very tasty but I do just want to say that on both occasions that I have come here, I experienced some horrifying stomach pain later that evening/night -- so much so that I would hardly get a wink of sleep even with stomach acid meds. This place is basically a GERD nightmare, so if you suffer from that, I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you talk to the staff and see if they have something steamed and non-oily/not-spicy. The oily-spicy combo may be typical of Szechuan food but I'm afraid it was also the culprit behind the symptoms that left me slithering in pain both nights after having eaten here for lunch.\n\nThat being said, perhaps this is my own stomach sensitivity and sadly my body might be rejecting all deliciously oily and spicy food. So for those with delicate digestion, look elsewhere. That is the only reason I wouldn't give this place a 4-star rating.

Don't order more than 2 if you are only 2 at the table - one is enough for two people (but maybe have 2 for variety and you would end up packing it anyway!).

Szechuan food! One of my favorite Chinese foods. I love spices and I love Szechuan spice. This place is one of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in the Twin Cities. I've only been here during lunch for their lunch box special, but it's really good. Very authentic!. I try to limit myself to eating out 1-2 meals a week, and when I do, I choose wisely and that means I choose Little Szechuan!! Little Szechuan is by far my most eaten restaurant in the Twin Cities. I've probably been there 50 times or so since the store opened in 2014. This place is legit!\n\nThe lunch box special includes either selection of one or combination of steamed rice, fried rice, or chow mien. Then you get to choose 3 dishes for a cost of $8.75. It's a little pricey, but they pack a lot of food, whether you dine-in or take it to-go. I recommend going to the oldish Chinese lady because she gives a lot more food than most of the other people that serve. She packs the to-go box a lot. A normal person can probably make 2 meals out of it... but I'm a big eater, so I eat it in 1 sitting.\n\nAs far as the dishes they offer during lunch, there is probably 10+ options a day. They do have some dishes that are there everyday such as their vegetable offering, which is really good, orange chicken and broccoli beef. The rest of the dishes usually vary. For example they always have a tofu dish, sometimes it's fried tofu (my favorite tofu dish) or sometimes it's water  boiled tofu with napa cabbage, sometimes it's mapo tofu (also pretty good). Also they usually have a fish dish: Either the spicy fried fish (by far my favorite overall dish they have) or more healthy spicy water boiled fish, which is good as well. So, when I go, I usually get a fish dish if they have it, tofu for sure, and either healthy stir-fry vegetable, which is quite flavorful, or eggplant if they have it. The eggplant is really good as well. Honestly, coming from California, it's sometimes hard finding good Chinese, more specifically Szechuan food in Minnesota. This is probably one of the best options you can get. I'd eat this everyday, if I wasn't watching my money or my weight haha.  \n\nOther things to note: \n\nThe line gets really long during lunch time, but generally is pretty fast. They do run out of my favorites a lot such as the fried fish, where I will have to wait for them to cook more, but generally they're pretty good about that. The lunch box special is served from 11AM-2PM. So make sure come during that time. \n\nAlso the special is only on weekdays!! If you come here, you don't have to get the lunch special: There's other options as well such as Beef Noodle Soup, which I heard was pretty spicy and good or order dishes and share family style.\n\nThis is a top Chinese option for students and family gatherings alike (They have 3 separate private rooms that are up for reservation).\n\n3 stars really doesn't do this place justice. It is on par if not better than HK noodle and Kowloon....let alone village wok..... I've lived in California where I've tried a plethora of Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants. This is definitely on bar with some of the most authentic and best tasting restaurants out on the West Coast. Honestly, if you observe the ratings at this place and only factor in the ratings given by Asians. This place would be 4 stars. Who would you trust more about opinions about good, authentic Chinese food? An Asian or non-Asian? I'll let you decide on that one. \n\nIn conclusion, if you want to some authentic, really good tasting Chinese option at a pretty affordable price. Definitely check this place out!! I have a bunch of pictures of the lunch boxes...check those out as well!"", 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}, 'datePublished': '2015-05-21'}, {'author': 'Jocelyn Y.', 'description': ""Food is great.  I went there with friends for lunch on a particular sunday.

The reasons I don't like it are that (1) it tastes a bit meaty for me, (2) the sauce tasted funny and 'fake.'

The fried dumpling appetizer seemed to set the tone for our meal: they were satisfying but ordinary.\n\nMy daughter ordered sesame chicken, her favorite Americanized-Chinese dish and was disappointed that the result was ""sweet and sour"" chicken with a few sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I was equally disappointed when my Kung Pao Chicken lacked spice. It seemed more like an order of Teriyaki Chicken with a few peppers added.\n\nThe highlight of the meal -- and the only item I\'d go back for -- was the sizzling beef. It was a welcome take on your typical \'beef with vegetable\' dish with the addition of fresh ginger and crispy rice.\n\nOn future visits to campus, I\'m likely to take my daughter to the Tea House on University (Stadium Village).

This place is a little more expensive but I believe they use higher quality ingredients and everything has a little more control to it.

I have to agree, Sis.  \n\nTammy, the owner, was our server. She is one of the sweetest women you could meet.  She spent the evening talking with us about her sauces, her deliciously unique dishes, and her story.  \n\nI\'m vegan but my family eats meat.  We started with Lavender Tea with ginger syrup that Tammy made. Delicate, spicy, aromatic and the perfect start to our meal.  Then, she recommended a peanut sauce noodle with rice noodles instead of egg noodles since I\'m vegan.  Everyone had a taste, delicious.\nMy family enjoyed a couple of chicken egg rolls as well. From how quickly they disappeared they seemed pretty yummy.\n\nThe main dishes arrived:\nMom got a staple of Chinese, Beef Chow Fun.  It was good (and honestly, from what I\'ve seen, seems to be good anywhere we go). \n\nMy sister got Tofu with Mixed Vegetables in Black Bean Sauce. Really good. Salty but slightly tart.  It tasted way better than most any dish I get in Chinatown in Chicago (where I live).  \n\nMy dad got the Spicy Pork with Cilantro.  This dish is unique (and I mean that in the best possible way). The cilantro, rather than being a spice or a garnish, is actually the green for this dish and sets it apart from any other plate I have seen.  This is the one that launched my sister over the moon.  I think Tammy\'s giving other Minneapolis establishments a run for their money with this one.  And this is just from seeing my family\'s response! \n\nI had the Mock Duck with Eggplant, Onion, and Tamarind sauce.  One of the best faux meat dishes I have ever had.  It\'s a lightly tart, pleasantly salted, robust veggie dish.  It\'s got me promising you that I\'m coming back to Rainbow every time I visit Minneapolis.  She\'s got other veggie dishes I\'m hankering to try.  So, enough said there. \n\nWe ended the evening with a chocolate wonton dessert, which was amazing, and a story from Tammy about her first experiences in New York with cooked black peppers. \n\nTo top it all off, the decor and atmosphere perfectly matches the food (edgy yet inviting with no possibility for denying the authenticity).  Tammy\'s accommodating warmth also really exemplified how the Captain sets the tone for the ship. \n\nToss in a bar that looked like a fun place to sit for an hour or two and bellies full of delicious Chinese cuisine and we didn\'t want to leave at the end of the night!\n\nOn top of all of that, we ordered Turnip Cakes with Egg and Scallions to take home.  We couldn\'t help it, we all had to have a taste when we got home (I eat egg once in a while) and well, we are the whole thing! Who knew that the dish we brought home as an extra would turn out to be one of the best dishes of the night! \n\nRainbow is a must for anyone who even remotely likes Asian food.  If they\'re still open, go tonight!\n\nCheers,\nJeff', 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}, 'datePublished': '2014-12-27'}, {'author': 'Lee V.', 'description': 'Rude staff.

I knew that this Hong Kong Noodles Restaurant might not be that good (learned from the photos taken by customers on Yelp). But I still tried their food for confirming which one is better. This so-called Hong Kong Noodles Restaurant actually is a American Chinese food restaurant. It was not authentic. First, I found many American Chinese food on their menu. Second, I chose  Wonton Noodles in Soup $9.95 that is a basic Hong Kong food for checking their quality. Then I found that it was $1 difference with steamed chicken so that I ordered ""Steamed Chicken Wonton Noodles in Soup $10.95"". I was surprised  to see those wontons that I have never had because it was full of lean pork with about 0.05% of frozen cut shrimp. The ratio of pork and Shrimp was not traditional Wontons. In addition, the ratio for pork inside should be 30/70 fat and lean pork. The soup was not good. That was not the soup for Cantonese Wonton noodles. Tasted nothing. Glad that I got the ginger-scallion oil sauce for adding the flavor for finishing it. The Hong Kong milk tea was not strong enough but it was ok quality. \nThird, Overall their service was too slow. Took 20 minutes for a cup of milk tea and 15 minutes for noodles. \nFourth, their food was too expensive for this kind of quality.

I was disappointed that there weren't very many people dining here. It's a great place for happy hour so not sure where everyone was.\n\nWe ordered house wine and dumplings from the happy hour menu. The steamed pork dumplings were generous in size and very flavorful with lots of real pork meat stuffed inside. \nWe shared the tangerine chicken and young chow fried rice for our entrees. These were less impressive than the dumplings. The tangerine/orange chicken was a huge portion but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. It needed more brown sauce or some spices to boost the zest.

My boyfriend and I ordered wonton soup, pork and preserved egg congee, pork spare ribs, mushroom and bok choy medley, beef chow fun, and xiao long bao (soup dumplings). Oh and a couple cocktails. Favorite was definitely the beef chow fun (I'm used to calling it ho fun but details details) - tender, tasty beef and delicious flat noodles. The xiao long bao was a disappointment as there was no soup really. We didn't even receive spoons, which are required for this dish if done right. I wonder if we just received a bad batch bc from the other Yelpers' photos, it looks like it comes in orders of 3 and we received 6. Also looked different than the photos as ours didn't have the flat extended bottoms. I'm willing to give it another try though as xiao long bao is one of my favorite things on earth! \n\nAtmosphere was trendy and dark, and menu had more American-ized options for those less adventurous for authentic Chinese cuisine.

Food same as any other sichuan place around.\n\nThey have 3 distinct dining areas - one with tons of spot lightning and windows, bar and small bar side stools/mini tables, and a very dimly lit area. Since I\'ll be taking lots of photos I opted for more light.\n\nHere\'s what we ordered-\nDan Dan noodles, Sliced Pork Belly, Pork Intestines, Cumin Lamb, Crispy Fish Filets.\nDrinks - Cranberry Fluff (cranberry, maple, lemon, eggwhite) Spring Crush (strawberry shrub, orange, lime, simple soda), Oolong Nog (oolong tea, pineapple juice, cream, nutmeg).\n\nThis is a relatively new place that just open in early Feb 2017. They seem to be working out the kinks with their menu as some stuff are not available or special items have changed styles. Shouldn\'t be an issue overall but just fyi.\n\nTheir drinks definitely stood out to me - it\'s in the fancy posh north loop neighborhood so their drinks menu does not disappoint. Great blend of Asian/Chinese ingredients in their cocktail menu. They do not offer sake here but instead the traditional and authentic bai jiu! Bai Jiu is a strong white distilled spirit - similar look and taste to vodka.\n\nFood wise - same as any other sichuan restaurant. You can always customize lower or higher spice levels. I would say it feels a bit tailor to the Western diner but with a higher end feel. They didn\'t seem to have an overwhelming numbing feel found at a traditional sichuan restaurant with the spice and peppercorns which I am glad it is toned down on the spice level!\n\nOne other food distinction - they do not seem to have actual hot pot as apparent to traditional sichuan restaurants. Think bowling pot of hot soup at your table with a fire underneath. Their menu gets confusing at this point so you would need to clarify with your waiter. We asked several of their ""hot pot"" items and it was actually a stir fried.. confusing indeed.\n\nParking - street metered, Valet Parking $8 or test your parking limits at Freehouse across the street with free parking at your own risk.', 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 4}, 'datePublished': '2017-04-06'}, {'author': 'Nichole R.', 'description': ""I LOVED Jun!\nI came on a Monday at 5:00 to an empty restaurant (score!) and they happily let me sit anywhere and wait for my girlfriend to arrive even though she was going to be a good 20 minutes.\nFast forward - we ordered Spicy Cucumbers on Happy Hour (OMG - get them) and Jun Fried Rice (veggie - extra egg) and it was some of the best fried rice I have ever had! -and I am super picky about my fried rice.\nThe service was also excellent - we even bellied up to the bar to have another drink after we were all finished up.

Shu mai (was ok), shrimp and chives (too doughy), shrimp and cilantro (good),  curried baby octopus (ok), mango crepes (horrible), sesame balls (not good- bready not chewy).  Crispy chicken sticky rice (delicious and so cute. Shaped like little birds). Items are between$6-8, so basically paying$2 for one dumpling. \n\nFrom menu, ordered Jun fried rice (delicious) and beef chow fun (beef was tender and tasty). Serving sizes are more single sided, not family style.  Also ordered Chinese broccoli... Can't review that because it never came... Which leads me to service review. \n\nSo we ordered from the dim sum menu and regular menu.  Not exaggerating on the wait time because I texted a friend when our dim sum arrived and then looked at my phone before I complained to our server.  Thirty minutes.  By the time the fried rice and chow fun arrived, was 40 min. Chinese broccoli never came out too.  Server blamed the chef but we seriously think he forgot to put in our order. Normally I would be more forgiving but he didn't take any ownership of the mistake. \n\nIn summary my bad review is based on service and wait time, as well as price.

But let me start with the positives - service here is EXCELLENT and alone gives a +1 star to their rating. Everything else though, was 2-stars at best - especially when you consider the other options for Szechuan and Chinese in Minneapolis that provide high quality at much lower price points. Here, you're paying for the ambiance and the service, but not very good food.\n\nLets start with the items that weren't even available because the kitchen ran out - Jun's Bao Bao and Jun's Pork Spare Ribs. You know, the two items that bear your restaurant's name and would supposedly be your best plates?\n\nWe settled on sichuan dumplings, a small bowl of hot and sour soup, snap peas, and La Zi chicken. However, aside from the soup, the first plate took nearly 40 minutes to serve despite the kitchen being fully staffed. Sure the place was busy, but it certainly wasn't packed.\n\nHot and Sour Soup - one of the worst I've ever tasted. Literally a bowl of vinegar that we had to dilute with soy sauce to even get down. Whoever made this never taste tested or has an amazing tolerance for sour.\n\nSnap Peas - can't really make this wrong. The peas were fresh so they retained the crunch. My only complaint is that the portion size is pretty tiny for $13. I'm sure you could get 10x this much if you purchase from market. Sure, there's the restaurant up-charge but this was a bit excessive. See pictures. \n\nSichuan Dumplings - 6 small dumplings that tasted reasonably good but doesn't compare well to other offerings in town that serve comparable quality for at least $2 less.\n\nLa Zi chicken - probably the best dish of the night with very tasty chicken. Something like fried chicken but retaining all their individual moisture. \n\nJun has a lot of potential because it is well situated with what seems like an excellent and enthusiastic staff. This isn't Szechuan cuisine for your grandmother, but rather Szechuan for the modern millennial.

Some of our party had a gluten intolerance, and he was able to talk to the kitchen to accommodate that, which was great. There wasn't soy sauce or a bowl of chili/garlic sitting on the table like most dim sum places, which was kind of disappointing.\n\nOk, let's get to the good stuff now:\n\n1) GF Chicken Wings - These wings were so delicious. The crunch was nice, the scallions were a great touch. It was seasoned perfectly. I would get these again for sure.\n\n2) Bun Bao (Veggie) - The bun itself was good, very fluffy and moist. The filling was mushrooms and carrots. It just seemed like someone forgot to insert the other half of the filling. It was definitely missing  a few elements. I would have liked to see cabbage or chinese broccoli. Something to complete the dish, and have it tied together.\n\n3) Shrimp dumplings - Pretty standard shrimp dumplings, nothing to really report about. \n\n4) Shrimp Rice Noodle Roll - This is usually one of my favorites, it was served with the sauce on the side for the GF people, which was fine. It also had 2 chinese broccolis on the side, which were really good. The shrimp roll itself - I plunged the noodles in the sauce bowl so it had plenty of sauce, these too were missing an element. They weren't bad, but they weren't good. I think the sauce just needed more flavor.\n\n5) Meatballs - These were kind of fun, they had a hint of orange to it. They were pretty decent, and came with 3 in a dish. I had half of a meatball, and that's all I really needed from that dish. Just enough to taste, but it didn't leave me feeling like I needed to eat the other half.\n\n6) Curry Octopus - I was super excited about this dish. It was a little limey, which was a surprise. All in all, it wasn't a bad dish. I'm glad I tried it. I think had the dish been called something other than curry, I wouldn't have much to complain about, but I was really looking for that curry flavor and it just wasn't there. But the dish itself, was good - just don't go into it expecting a huge curry flavor.\n\n7) Fried Taro Balls - I would not get these again. They were overly greasy, and they were super bland. I tried to dip it in a sauce, and they were still bland. Not great at all.\n\n8) Turnip Cakes - Hmmm, these were super mushy. Almost like they weren't done completely. It was so hard for me to tell what the flavor was like because the consistency of the cakes were like custard once you tried to pick up a piece. \n\nI felt like this meal just did not hit the spot, and it was on the pricey end. The quality did not match the price. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was so-so. Now I will have to see what some of their other competitors have to offer before I circle back around again.

It\'s about time \'Sota leveled up their hot pot game!\n\nThings to know:\n*****\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Dinkytown is undergoing a facelift ***cough-cough-gentrification-cough-cough*** but I welcome new joints like Tasty Pot and the immaculate mini-Target/ soon-to-be Walgreens & CVS slayer on the corner. One should have no problem finding this eatery using either Waze or Google Maps.\n\nAbout parking, well, this area has historically been challenging. Paid lots and street parking are available. Best of luck, tributes! \n\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Hot pot refers to a pot cooking food in a broth. What separates Tasty Pot from other joints I\'ve been to (and experienced at my parents\' crib) is that instead of being shared pot, which is typical, each person receives his or her own. \n\nThis restaurant has ten different types of pots to choose from. Patrons also have the choice of adding spice (none to flaming spicy), and an option for a carb (vermicelli or rice). Add some spice and choose vermicelli. \n\nAgain, I went with their Taiwanese Supreme Spicy Hot Pot Soup, and it consists of the following ingredients:\n \n- Taiwanese cabbage\n- Instant noodles\n- Beef slices\n- Beef tendon\n- Enoki mushroom\n- Tempura\n- Clam \n- Fuzhou fishball\n- Cuttlefish ring\n- Pork blood rice cake\n- Pork intestine\n- Fried tofu skin\n- Brown beech mushroom\n- Firm tofu\n- Imitation crabmeat\n- Meatball\n- Sour mustard\n- Fried tofu puff\n- Cilantro\n- Scallion\n- Spicy peppers to induce flaming booty-burn. \n\nAs I near Yelp\'s maximum character count and feel like blacking out because my fingers became so tired while typing, I realize that I consumed a village-worth of food right thrrrrr. About the food itself, the ingredients are very Asian-grocery store-typical aka nothing is remarkable. However, that doesn\'t mean it ain\'t good.\n\nThe best part of the hot pot is at the end. When all the ingredients are eaten, and the broth is the only thing left, the broth becomes very flavorful. ""Sip, sip on some szyurrrpppp."" #Three6Mafia \n\nIII. SERVICE: Decently fast. Very friendly. No problems here.\n\nIV. AMBIENCE & DECOR: Pretty clean and spacious. Great for large groups. Consider calling in to RSVP a table, though, if you have a big party. \n\nV. PRICES: $14 for each hot pot, which is HELLA affordable for the amount of food one person receives. Like, I would suggest to peeps to not eat the entire day before eating at Tasty Pot. \n\nVI.

Before Tastypot and LePot (which coincidentally opened up right down the block at around the same time), there really haven\'t been places dedicated solely to hotpot in the Twin Cities. \n\nThe menu and ordering process is a bit strange as there are 10 different designated hotpot options to choose, and 7 of the 10 options only come in the small hotpot size and the other 3 options only come in the large sizes. Add ons can be ordered at an additional price and each hotpot you select comes with an option of a bowl of rice or vermicelli noodles. For lunch, the ""small"" options (#1-7) are $12.99 and $13.99 for dinner. For the ""large"" options (#8-10), it costs $15.99 for lunch and $16.99 for dinner. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nTaiwanese Supreme Spicy Hot Soup (2/5 stars) $16.99: \n\nWhile the description seemed to entail a hotpot loaded with an abundance of hotpot items such as tempera, crabmeat, scallion, etc..., it was extremely disappointing to discover how deceivingly large and fruitful the hotpot was. Essentially, the hotpot was made up of 70% cabbage and it felt like there was one of each listed item in the soup. It seemed like the amount of noodles in the soup amounted to one mouthful. Very comparable to if you\'ve ever gotten bubble tea or any other ice drink and discover you almost finished it all after seemingly 3 sips because the ice cubes take up so much of the drink itself. The broth itself wasn\'t bad and quite spicy even for a ""medium"" spiciness selected, which is interesting because most Taiwanese food is quite light and more sweet than spicy. \n\nJapanese Miso Hot Soup (3/5 stars): $16.99: \n\nI actually quite enjoyed the sweet and flavorful broth of the Japanese hotpot, but again was disappointed to see there was barely any filling in the hotpot except mostly cabbage. \n\n\nOverall, the hotpots were pretty authentic and this would be a good place to try hotpot for the first time. But it was disappointing that for the higher end price, you receive a hotpot mostly of cabbage. The pictures and descriptions on the menu are deceiving with how large and full the hotpots appear.

However it's only located in NorCal and San Diego at the time. I'm from LA so they haven't came yet. \n\nThey have a number of different hot pots to try. Be sure to try them all! We both got the beef hot pot. It's 11.99 for lunch and 12.99 for dinner. Same size. There's also several other ones like Taiwanese hot one that cost a few dollars more because they're larger.

It's a larger size and comes with ramen noodles on the bottom. It has a lot of stuff I don't eat though: like intestine. One thing I do like is the Pork Blood Rice Cake; that's the only reason why I get the Taiwanese Hot. \n\nThe sauce is solid as well. There's 3 different sauces.

You simply just choose your pot, your spice level, and your side (rice or vermicelli noodles). The sauces are TO DIE FOR. Mix all three of them together and dip all your ingredients into the sauce; it is a game-changer to have good dipping sauce when you\'re eating hot pot.\n\nDepending on which one you\'re interested in, the individualized hot pots range from $12-15 for lunch and $13-16 for dinner. If you ask me, this is pretty cheap for hot pot. At other hot pot places where you have to buy each ingredient individually, it gets super pricey. So this is pretty affordable. \n\nAs your soup starts boiling, it gets pretty hot. You can always shut off the fire. There\'s a little nob on the side of your individual pot and if you just switch this, the fire will turn off. When you start running low on soup, you can always flag down a waiter to refill it but just to note, the broth they give is just ""normal"" so if you ordered a spicy one, it will make your broth a little less spicy.\n\nI went with the medium spicy beef hot pot (#1). It has a sufficient amount of ingredients already in it. Though you can add more if you feel like it at an additional cost, it definitely has enough to make anyone full.

Then you ring the buzzer to the side and your waiter takes your order. The meal comes out within 5 mins! Also, you have the option of making your own sauce at the ""sauce area"" - this was a really unique and fun concept! When the soup arrives it\'s placed on your own individual stove and everything cooks right in front of you! The fish ball sides and beef were my favorite! At the end of your meal you got a cute little cheesecake (included in the price). The waiters also refill your soup broth for FREE!

Dessert is included too - either a mini-cheesecake or an herbal jelly (would definitely recommend the cheesecake over the jelly lol). They have a sauce station on the side where you can combine various things to make a yummy dipping sauce. \n\nThe combo sets are slightly different in the terms of the main meat, but all come with a nice variety of other side items too, including various veggies, tofu, fishballs, quail eggs, etc. I liked sampling a bit of everything. And they were surprisingly filling too! At the end, the broth is really flavorful, which is delicious to drink with either noodles or rice. \n\nThe only thing I would have liked to see is some strainers to help you fish out the items from the soup (they just give you a spoon and chopsticks). Also, they only give you one bowl which is for the dipping sauce, but we asked for extra bowls that we could put cooked items in.

For those of you unfamiliar with what hotpot is, it\'s a traditional Chinese way of eating, typically on special occasions. You place a boiling pot of broth in the middle and dip raw ingredients into the broth to cook (meats, vegetables, noodles, etc.). At this restaurant, you get your own individualized pot and set of ingredients. \n\nI came here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty packed. Their service is pretty slow as of currently. From arrival, there was only 1 party of 2 in front of us, but it took over an hour to even be seated. As parties from various tables left, I could see that the staff were not that great at clearing the tables quickly. But the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. As of now, just expect a long wait.\n\nUpon entry, approach the cashier and let her know your party size. There are plenty of chairs and space to wait. Once seated, you choose a broth, a combo, and a side. Each table has multiple hot plates on it that you can control the temperature for which is extremely nice. I ordered the House Spicy (medium spicy) with the beef combo. The medium spicy was already really spicy so if you\'re not a huge fan of spice, I\'d either choose one with no spice at all or go with the mild option. Each plate comes with a large variety of ingredients, allowing you to really taste all the different components that usually make up a hot pot which is nice. The broth itself was just okay, not extremely flavorful or anything.\n\nWhile you wait for your food, you can do one of two things. They have a side table that is filled with different sauces. You can go up there and prepare your own unique sauce so you can dip your cooked ingredients into to give it a little more taste. You can also order boba from Kung Fu Tea which is inside Le Pot and your waiter will bring it up to you (but you actually have to go to the counter to order it rather than giving your order to the waiter).\n\nYou also get a free dessert with any purchase, called ""bing fen"" in Chinese. Unfortunately when I came, they were out so I was not able to try this. They were also out of rice.\n\nOverall, I think the food is pretty good with a nice selection of ingredients. They still have some kinks to work out in terms of service, but that\'s to be expected with a brand new restaurant.', 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 3}, 'datePublished': '2017-05-09'}, {'author': 'Jonathan L.', 'description': ""Le Pot + Kung Fu Tea! \n\nWhat a 1-2 Punch! Le Pot is located right between Target and Jersey Mike's. Le Pot serves Chinese Hot Pot and Kung Fu Tea serves delicious Taiwanese Boba. Very exciting to have an individual hot pot spot finally pop up in Minnesota. There's a bountiful in California, but non here until the opening of Le Pot.\n\nWe came here on a Tuesday around 8:45PM, 3 days after grand opening. The wait was pretty long. We waited maybe 20-30 minutes, though the waiter said there was only 1 group ahead of us. The seating is kind of weird in which tables were either of 2 or of 6. So sometimes they would place 2 groups of 2 in a table of 6 and leave 2 spots open to allow for space between the customers. It can be uncomfortable if they didn't leave a space between the parties. If they have some sort of divider, maybe it would be ok. \n\nNow onto the Menu/Food. The menu is pretty simple.\n1. You choose your soup base. Plenty of options here: House spicy, Mala Spicy, House Original, Real Pork Bone and several others. I got the House spicy -Medium. It was pretty dang spicy! I love spicy food and I could barely handle it. Next time I probably would go with mild. \n\n2. You choose your meat combo: There's Beef, Pork, Lamb, veggies and a few others. I ordered the Beef which was 13.99. The combo comes with a preset of various hot pot items such as clam, quail egg, napa lettuce, fish balls, carrot, broccoli, mushrooms, tofu, spam and some others.\n\n3. Your Carb Choice: Rice, vermicelli, fine noodles, or instant noodles. I ordered rice, but was later told it was sold out.... so I went and changed it to vermicelli. \n\n4. You get a dessert: Option was icy jelly...which we unfortunately wasn't able to try because they were sold out again.. \n\n5. Lastly you can order additional items if you're still hungry like extra beef, fish balls, tofu, veggies etc... I suggest start with the starter pack and add on later if you're still hungry. I thought the combo alone wasn't going to fill my big stomach up, but it did! \n\nThe food itself is good and priced reasonable. Basically just throw all the raw stuff into the hot pot! Then wait to boil and eat! You get to control the temperature of your hotpot. Beef is frozen beef, possibly from Shanghai Wholesale. It's aight. Quail egg is yummy, napa, tofu, spam were good too. The broth is quite spicy! Be prepared for a fight. I suggest starting at mild, then working your way up. If you prefer to cook your own food le pot might be for you. \n\nOverall it's a nice addition to U of M campus. It should get good business due to the need of hot pot around campus. However, another hot pot place is opening up soon a block away called Tasty Pot - Taiwanese Cuisine, which I'm really excited about. \n \nThe service here is really good, at least the one skinny, tall Chinese dude is. He's very nice and patient. Though they were out of rice and dessert.. that's understandable for a restaurant just opening... but hopefully they get that fixed up soon.  \n\nCheck this place out!

It was our first time trying Chinese Hot Pot cuisine, and Le Pot was a wonderful introduction.  We didn't exactly come in blind.  Watching a few videos on YouTube  (Strictly Dumpling channel) helped us figure out a few of the basics.  Also helps if you've eaten at a fondue restaurant before, as it is somewhat similar.\n\nService here was incredible.  Several wait staff  were always around asking if we needed anything.  I ordered the beef combo w/ ramen and mushroom broth and a side of spring bamboo.  My wife ordered the lamb combo w/ vermicelli and house spicy broth and a side of quail eggs.  Each of us also made up some sauce for dipping off of their sauce bar.  They have a few suggestions posted for sauce combos.  There are call buttons if you require assistance, but they came around so often we never used the call button.\n\nEverything came out very fast and fresh.  Broth to heat first, and then a large bento box full of the combo ingredients.  The beef and lamb were sliced super thin, and cooked in seconds.  All of the things looked and tasted very fresh and well kept.  The sides we ordered were very healthy portions of each.  The spring bamboo was very tender, best I've had.  \n\nThere were a lot of firsts here, all of them wonderful.  First time eating beef tendon balls.  Simmer for a couple minutes, and they were amazingly tender.  Completely unexpected in a good and flavorful  way.  I imagined I'd be chewing on a tire.   Hah!  First time having fish balls, and stuffed ones as well.  Great flavor.\n\nSpeaking of, the mushroom broth is incredible.  It's subtle and powerful at the same time.  Rich with mushroom goodness without being heavy.  If you call this a pot of soup, it's quite possibly the best pot of soup I've had, bar none.  The spicy is also good, but my wife agreed the mushroom broth was outstanding.  The staff also raves about the light tomato broth, and suggest adding some hot chili oil.  Mushroom broth didn't need anything.  I'm a spice fiend, and didn't miss it, which is saying something.  Six stars out of five.\n\nCouple warnings, they do close at 10, but begin shutting down the raw bar at 930ish for reorders.  They gave us ample warning, though.  The other is don't accidently hit the cooker with your knees under the table.  There's plenty of legroom, but if you raise your knees too high you could bump the thing out of place.\n\nAlso the value for the cuisine is top notch.  This meal was amazing considering the price.

Came last night with a group of friends for a birthday and it did not disappoint. They have tables which seats 4 or 6 people. They have about 13-15 tables max. It's a very small establishment with a separate company Kung Fu Tea attached located towards the front of the restaurant. \n\nThe broth I ordered was the mushroom flavor with hot as the spice level. It was a perfect blend of spice and it compares to a simple pork broth. We also ordered the spicy house broth which ended up being just ok, the flavor was mediocre and didn't compliment any of the foods while cooking it, all you could taste was just spice. We also ordered the Mala spicy which is the potent Szechuan flavor with peppercorns in the soup(very annoying to eat). I highly advise if you like the numbing and super spicy sensation on your tongue then this is up your alley, if you have NOT had it before, don't do it. It alters your taste buds when you eat other things afterwards and ruins the moment. Enough with the broth, let's move onto the meat combo selections and other items.\n\nWe tried the seafood combo and beef combo. Seafood combo isn't bad, after eating it all, I didn't care about it other than the decent size head on shrimp. The clams and squid, it was good but I didn't care for it. The star of it all, were the beef tendon balls. If y'all read my pho reviews, that's all I eat so I pretty much mastered the beef ball category. So trust me when I tell you, the beef balls are good. You only get a few with your beef combo so if you like em, get a side order. The beef slices tho, Oh man they were so yummy, its sliced very paper thin with very little fat trimmings. We all ordered egg noodles but I receive ramen noodles?? Oh well, I didn't mind! I broke my noodles in half, and cooked the first portion right away and saved the last portion for later, it prevents soggy noodles during the duration of eating. The combo per person id say is the perfect portion. We ate 97% of everything on our individual platter.\n\nExtra bowls are helpful because as you cook the items, it's literally way too hot in your mouth to consume. Scoop out some broth into a separate bowl, and place your cooked items there to cool down for a minute or two and then devour. I kept the heating temperature from 80-120 for the low/med heat. \n\nEnough said, I'll be coming back here to eat, very 5 star worthy."", 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 5}, 'datePublished': '2017-07-24'}, {'author': 'Dorothy C.', 'description': ""My friend had been raving about this place since it opened and had already been here 10x (it's only been open for 1.5 months!) so you know I finally had to give in had and go with. \n \nAnd boy am I glad I did!\n1) individual hot pots!

We had the fish with some vegetables, I don\'t know the English name for it but that dish really showed true skill from a chef whom prepared it without making the fish overly flaky or undercook. However, their roast pork was speaks a different story and was quite disappointing.

Although it took quite a while for it to come out. We were considering just asking for the bill for our drinks (4 sodas) and leaving, but opted to wait it out since we ordered the duck.\n\nThe Peking Duck came next, and it was just terrible. The meat was dried out badly and tasteless, the skin portion wasn't crispy and equally flavorless. The weirdest part were the pancakes. I'm used to the pillowy, soft, steamed pancakes; I've even had a friend make me the pan-fried ones for leftover moo shu pork. These were not either. They were cold, brittle, and were very tortilla-like. Between the awful duck and the unusual (?) pancakes, we left 90% of it on the plate. I think my friends took it home for their pets, because we all agreed it was awful.\n\nThe Eggplant in Garlic Sauce was okay, but cold. I'm not a fan of eggplant, so I only took one piece, but my friends took it home in a to-go box so I assume it wasn't bad. \n\nThe pork buns came out last (to be fair, they had told us when we ordered them it would be 15-20 minutes). Again, we were really surprised when we opened the tin. Because every time I've ordered steamed pork buns I got the soft dough with shredded pork in the middle. This was a steamed dumpling with a pork meatball (unseasoned) in the middle. Again, it was just terrible, and it was the only thing that came to our table hot.\n\nOur waiter never came back after the pork buns, and I finally flagged down another waitress to pay our bill. I think it might've been a shift change. We came in at 4 and didn't end up leaving until 5:45. Most of this was spent waiting on either our food or the waitstaff. Again, they were very sweet so we didn't take it out on them. \n\nSummary- I won't be back. While the waitstaff is sweet, they are far too slow for a restaurant that only had 3 tables sat. The food was atrocious, and I feel like if a restaurant isn't willing to pay attention to the slew of 1 star reviews lately, they aren't likely to change."", 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 1}, 'datePublished': '2017-08-09'}, {'author': 'Maggie A.', 'description': 'Ordered delivery, my smoothie tasted like paste.

Loved that they had fresh scallions and were so scrumptious. Coming back for these ASAP.\n\n#44 Curry Tam Yam with chicken - a spicy curry soup with fresh lime juice, mushrooms, quail eggs, kaffir lime leaf, lemon grass, green onions, basil, and chunks of chicken.

Crunchy bits on the meat and contrasted with fresh and pickled veggies. So good! \n\n#61 Fried shrimp with peppers - whole body shrimp with their eyes fried to perfection with full heads in-tact. I eat the whole thing. Could be an Asian thang. \n\nService was pleasant and professional. The place is a total dive but clean.

I wish I ordered a size of rice with this and it would have been a perfect meal! It had a nice spicy kick to and you can taste the soy sauce and other marinates in it.

It was rather gristly. Other than that,, the dumplings, seaweed salad, and other dishes were yummy. I especially love soup dumplings, so I have excited when that came around. I should have taken more than one, as I wanted to have at least one more before leaving.

I have a feeling that one must come right when they\'re opening for the day in order to get a seat that doesn\'t involve a long wait.\n\nI am pondering having my family come here, though my daughter also attended this event. I think that it would be a fun family outing where we can relax a bit more than being seated with six other people at a table. Yes, it was great chatting with the other Yelpers, too. I\'ve been enjoying seeing new faces and learning more about my fellow Yelpers.\n\nI was, too, glad that I didn\'t have a late dinner the night before coming to Yangtze.

I don't get to dim sum very often because my wife isn't a fan of dim sum. Just not her thing. And while I could go alone, dim sum is so much better with a group of people. We have done this with my extended family and the only time anyone fights is when too many people get their hands on the Lazy Susan and try to turn it in their direction. This day we came with a group of 20 Yelp friends. This day had an additional special meaning to me as this was the last restaurant that I went to with my dad. We arrived a few minutes early and within minutes people started getting out of their cars and lined up outside. Before you could open a fortune cooking the line stretched down the sidewalk. We quickly made it inside and were seated right away. As soon as we were seated the fun started.\nIf you have never experienced dim sum, its quite a spectacle. Glasses of water and hot tea is brought out. Before you know it there are ladies pushing carts full of goodies all around the dining room and bringing happiness to your table. For a Chinese guy I don't know the names of all the treats that I love to eat but I remember what they look like. Their some dumpling like items with shrimp that I love. Also a flat noodle with shrimp is fast becoming a favorite. There is sticky rice which is always good and fried taro root that is great with some chili sauce. This is where eating with your eyes comes back to take a bite out of your rear end. As you eat and enjoy your food, new carts are coming by and oh that looks good and oh I'll try that. Similar to going to Fogo but with lots of tasty Asian food. Before you know you get full. Too full. As I sat that and savored all the goodies I had and the memories of my father, I found some cracks and had a few more bites. \nI thought the quality was good as well as the service.

It's located in a pretty busy intersection and parking can always be a pain in a butt, but that's expected with anything downtown St. Paul and Minneapolis. Everytime I'm around Cedar and Riverside, I always need to stop by in. Over the years, prices has steadily gone up but is still quite reasonable for the quality and consistency remains relatively the same. If you're craving egg tarts from Chinese Dim Sum, Keefer's the solution.\n\nGrowing up as a child, donuts and cupcakes weren't always an appropriate choice in the household if I was craving sweets. Instead, my father would prefer treats to be on the savory side or to be more of a meal. Luckily, BBQ Pork Buns & Curry Buns fit this requirement. He also found them to be a more nutritional and filling snack than Americanized sweets such as cheesecake, pie, etc. It's also much cheaper; items range from 2-4$.\n\nI've had about every bakery item at Keefer's and believe that their holy trinity encompasses the BBQ Pork Bun, Egg Tart and Curry Bun. The buns are buttery and glossy, with the right amount of chewiness. One bite in and you're hit with mouthwatering pork that is seasoned and well-fragranced. The same applies to the Curry Bun, but instead of the taste of Chinese BBQ, you have more of a strong aroma of curry powder and spices. There's also a hit of chili pepper which adds an interesting kick. \n\nEgg Tarts are absolutely amazing and remain to be a top childhood favorite. The flaky crust from the tarts crumbles from each and every bite and its dryness acts as a perfect contrast to the partially juicy, delicate, semi-sweet egg filling. The egg tarts here are very popular in demand and sell quite quickly, so don't always expect them to have any left towards the end of the night. Unfortunately, over the years, the crust has gone through many transformations. I recall the crust to have these beautiful rigid edges resembling a pie crust, but now these edges are nowhere to be seen. \n\nAs for their other bakery items: I occasionally, but rarely grab one of their Coffee Cakes, Sweet-Cream Butter Spirals, or Ham and Cheese Buns. Both the Coffee Cake and Butter Spirals use the same butter-cream base which is less overbearing and sweet than the traditional sweet cream/icing base. The Coffee Cake is moist and has hints of coffee, but dries up pretty quickly, whereas the Spiral Cones are crunchy and flaky; dusted with sugar on the outre shell. As for the ham and egg buns, they're pretty mediocre.\n\nIf you're wanting to try Asian, specifically Chinese bakery items, this is the place. But, please remember to bring cash. The owners are fairly strict on it. There's an ATM just outside the door, but there's a 3$ service fee.

Our waiter arrived some minutes afterwards, and took our orders with some confusion across his face. Still, he assured us that he wrote down our orders for hot and sour soup, our Tropical Margarita and Old Fashioned cocktail drinks, and my Crispy Duck and Flor\'s Tofu with Mixed Vegetables orders. Our soup arrived not too many minutes later and tasted sour, hot, delicious. However, our drinks still had not arrived and almost 20 minutes later, our drinks finally came to the table.\n\nThen, the evening took a downward turn. Almost 40-45 minutes passed before Flor\'s order arrived and appearing nothing like she had requested off of the menu. With no images on the menu and guessing through what else her dish could have been called, she eventually settled on a Tofu Home-Style option. Some minutes after this conundrum, our waiter returned to say that there was no duck available. \n\nPerplexed and observing the first time in my memory that a restaurant order had not been available and unannounced for that long, I browsed the menu and found a promising sounding Lamb with Pure Cumin entree. ""A Popular Favorite."" An additional 35-40 minutes passed before Flor\'s entree arrived and at last was to her liking. Still waiting and only several minutes after this point, I joked with Flor that if I couldn\'t secure another entree, we could go to McDonald\'s in Dinkytown and I could buy 1-2 Big Macs to eat. Approximately 10-15 minutes after this time, our waiter emerged again and said that there was no lamb available.\n\nCan you say, ""Big Mac?""\n\nFrustrated at this point, I replied to our waiter that I would not be ordering anything additional off of the menu on my side. So, with Flor feeling sadder, she and I shared the Tofu Home-Style, which proved well-saut√©ed, with tender vegetables, juicy tofu, and well-spiced flavors. \n\nPlus, when we were ready to leave and pay our check, another 20-25 minutes passed with no stopover from our waiter. So, I took our finished plate with fork on said plate directly up to the host table and told the manager there that we were ready to pay and that our waiter had not arrived. She apologized and printed out our check, which included the imaginary ""Lamb with Pure Cumin"" entree which never arrived. I pointed out this error to the manager and she corrected and printed out a new receipt.\n\nWe paid, included no tip, and left out. I honestly cannot remember a prior restaurant experience with such abysmal customer service. I offer one star today for the quality of the food which we did receive, as well as their willingness to prepare a new entree for Flor after the initial confusion. Still, to not notify your customers in advance that you may be out of not one but two meat types, AND to leave your customers hanging when they want to pay their check, it becomes one of those ""REEEEEEEAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLYYYYYYY?!"" moments. \n\nSo, how did our evening conclude? Well, of course, we drove over to the McDonald\'s in Dinkytown afterwards. I ended up ordering one Big Mac, and Flor and I shared medium-size fries and a mango-pineapple smoothie, enjoying it all in the McDonald\'s parking lot. I love Flor\'s humor and patience through it all, but seriously...\n\nMaybe do delivery or take-out from Lao Sze Chuan, but be warned, you could risk a sort of dining purgatory or worse if you try to dine in at Lao Sze Chuan.', 'reviewRating': {'ratingValue': 1}, 'datePublished': '2017-11-27'}, {'author': 'Molly M.', 'description': ""Not for the faint hearted!

Water Boiled Fish - One of the most popular fish Szechuan dishes. This dish is wonderful; it comes with perfectly cooked fish over a bed of tofu and vegetables in a spicy Szechuan sauce.

It looks great in pictures, but the taste of the sauce is not impressive.\n\n4. Garlic Eggplant - In general, I like this dish since I'm an eggplant fan.

Pork and Shredded Tofu - I usually love this dish, but I feel like the pork at this place is a little fattier than I want it to be.\n\n6. Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - Not a fan.

We are there last before our baby was born. We ordered the chicken lo mein, boiled spicy fish, garlic Choy leaves and spicy ChungKing chicken. Couldn't finish all of it, but ate as much as we could. Our baby girl had just the chicken lo mein. \n\nWell, late that night, after having her usual nightly milk, our baby vomited everything she had in her tiny belly, then some more, and more every 1/2 hour until we took her to urgent care at 8am on Sunday. They calmed her belly with some anti-nausea meds. \n\nLater that day (Sunday), my wife threw up and had major vomiting all day. We tried everything to calm her belly, nothing worked. By night time, her stomach cramps and diarrhea started. Needless to say, she was bed ridden all day Sunday. She could eat a morsel of food all day. \n\nLater Sunday night, I had major bowel movements and diarrhea. It continued all night. And on Monday I had to cancel my work schedule to roll up in bed with a fever and major constipation followed by more abdominal cramps.  \n\nAs I write this, I am at the Minneapolis Children's hospital awaiting IV drip for my 2 year old who can't hold an ounce of liquid or food since Saturday afternoon. She's vomited over a dozen times since Saturday's lunch and is undergoing grueling pain for the IV drip she has to undergo it for the next few hours. We still don't know where all this will lead to.\n\nBoth the wife and I have flushed out the bad stuff (somewhat). We're still recovering but the damage is done. Neither of us has eaten anything other than fruits or juices since Saturday. \n\nThe doctors and we believe the last meal we ate was the culprit for all our gastric nightmare. It's not a virus, they contend... something bacterial we ate. And that was at Grand Szechuan Saturday late afternoon.\n\nAll I can say is, eating here was a delight but after all that's happened I just want others to know that the risks have outweighed the appetizing value of Grand Szechuan.

The Chung King Chili Chicken comes extra spicy (noted by the 2 chili peppers next to the name on the menu), cooked with onion, red and green bell peppers, and multiple dry chili peppers.

The Beef and Tofu in Hot Broth also comes extra spicy. It was garnished with green nonions but someone hates it so it was removed from the broth. The beef and tofu were a little soft but not in an unenjoyable texture. The broth was a perfect spicy.

My first har gow order was mushy and a bit weird tasting, but the second order was normal. Consistency would be the second ding. I sometimes see rice noodle rolls during my visits - these are alright. FYI: they have great chili oil for dipping!\n\nService is terrible. None of my empty dishes are taken from my table unless I ask. Water glasses are dirty. It is hard to communicate because most of the servers do not speak English. I have seen a few tables beside me become angry because food carts do not make it to their section. Make sure to double check and keep count of how many dishes you order because you might have an extra dish or two added on. Also, don't order the Chinese broccoli. They charge you $5 and it is never worth it. \n\nOverall, my experiences have been meh to average - good and bad.

Well, not only was our table of seven not ready, but they didn't even have enough chairs! (lol!) When we asked them if they could get the chairs for us, THEY TOLD US TO CARRY THE CHAIRS FROM THE WAITING AREA IN TO THE DINING ROOM OURSELVES. Lol! Yo, we ain't your cousins.

She didn't even apologies, despite doing so several times. If I knew which car was hers, I definitely would've considered stealing her tire caps. That's right. Don't mess with my ma, or you'll lose your tire caps. Or worse.\n\nAlthough both of these incidences were whack, they're totally forgivable if they had great food. But it wasn't. I rarely ever complain about restaurant service, too.\n\nUpdate:\n-I forgot to mention that they gave us a few dirty plates. Huge egg stains on them. Ew. \n\nIII.

I had 2 orders of har gow, one cheong fun, some tripe, various dumpling dishes, and buns.\n\nNeedless to say, I was pretty disappointed. The har gow did not taste good at all. The shrimp inside was very hard and had very little flavor to it. The dumpling itself had a very thick, outer wrapping unlike other dim sum places. The cheong fun\'s rice noodle was super thick and had a very thick ""rice"" taste. Usually at other dim sum places, the rice noodle comes much thinner. The sweet soy sauce tasted odd too. It had more of a sweet ""brothy"" taste than a sweet soy sauce taste. Most of the dishes had the frozen re-steamed taste to it.\n\nAlso, while trying to enjoy our food, one of the waitresses was vacuuming the restaurant which made me super uncomfortable.

The restaurant is pretty clean for the most part and generally pleasant. It does tend to be on the more crowded side, similar to Yangtze over in St. Louis Park, but not quite as tight.\n\nService: Service for dim sum was good. ""Team House"" style service with the tranditional carts is always fast. The servers were polite and punctual. Special requests always take longer on weekend dim sum service, so waiting a little extra wasn\'t unexpected. It was a little unusual for the servers to take so long to process our bill. We had money sitting out -waiting- to be taken, and they came and went by us multiple times to help get water, etc. for other customers.

PLACE.\n\nMy go-to Chinese restaurant for YEARS (say, 25 years) was Village Wok at the University of MN. I absolutely adored that place. I adored their late night hours and their food and their server Fran (who is the best server ever). But then someone bought the building they are in and is in the process of converting it into condos... so VW closed down last year. I was sad, I was upset, I was mad. I had to find a replacement!\n\nPeking Garden is located in a run down strip mall in Frogtown. Being in a corner, it looks dubious. I had many doubts...until I walked in. 98% of the patrons were Asian families--to me, that is an indicator that this is a great and authentic place to eat. The servers are all young adults in their 20s-30s but don\'t let that fool you, I\'ve seen them prep vegetables as well as eat the food here--another indication that this place was good (and family run). The place was clean and spacious. They have a small section of tanks where they keep live lobsters, crabs, sole, etc.\n\nThey have a fairly large menu, similar to VW, but hey--I love choices. I love getting the combination plates, it lets me have a little bit of several favorite items without any leftovers. So I ordered the Roast Duck and Roast Pork rice plate. Service was fine, I didn\'t have to wait long and they let me change tables (I prefer booth seating). When my food came, I was in heaven. I had lucked out and gotten some great pieces of duck and pork, not overly fatty, not odd parts. It also came with a side of Chinese broccoli--which was DELICIOUS btw and perfect for cutting down the richness of the two meats. The duck was perfect and I had to admit, even better than VW\'s--it wasn\'t dry or overcooked. Same with the roast pork. Just perfect cuts, perfect roast, perfect greens, perfect rice--everything was right in the world.\n\nThe complimentary tea was nice and my SO and I drank the entire thing between the two of us. We also ordered the cream cheese wontons and were so blown away by how good they were, we ordered another. Now, some people will say stupid things like ""you can\'t screw up cream cheese wontons""--don\'t listen to those people, don\'t even read the rest of their reviews. These were the best cream cheese wontons I\'ve had so far, the wrappers were thin, delicate and crisp and held just the right about of cream cheese inside. Two bottles of sauce come with the wontons: a watered down (at least it looks that way to me) plum sauce and mustard. I actually kind of enjoyed squeezing the sauce onto the wonton and it was all delicious.\n\nI was in heaven, I can\'t even remember what my SO ordered.\n\nThis place is also open late (2am on Fri/Sat!) so I can see lots of memories with friends and family being made in the future, just like it has been with VW in the past.

I was hungry and in a time crunch though so I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I\'d never dined there before.\n\nAfter confirming my phone number and address twice with the delivery taker, I waited about an hour and a half before calling back to check on my order. The same woman then informed me that the delivery driver had attempted to deliver my food and returned and that my card had been declined.\n\nAlthough we\'d confirmed my number and address twice, she repeated back a correct address but a phone number with a different area code. We tried my debit card number again with success and I conceded with as much patience as I could muster that we may have had a bad connection earlier. She apologized and guaranteed that my order would arrive in 25-40 minutes.\n\nAbout an hour and a quarter later I called back again. She again stated that the driver had come and gone and blamed me for providing incorrect information. \n\nAt this point I asked for a refund. She then asked me the question ""So are you asking for your food and a refund?"" After a pause I responded ""Yes, actually I am. I\'ve been waiting nearly three hours and have already been charged"". \n\nShe than asked me to hold for a manager, set the phone down, proceeded to audibly mock and laugh at me and then apparently hung up.\n\nI immediately called back stating that perhaps we\'d been disconnected.\n\nAfter a brief hold I was then able to speak with a manager who immediately began interrupting me by repeating the words ""what, what, what?"" while stifling his laughter.\n\nI informed him I felt he was being intentionally disrespectful to me while not providing me with the service that I had paid for in good faith.

The pick up was done at the time I specified and I did note how clean the restaurant is with a few chairs and tables to sit at while waiting for the food. Several people were also waiting for pick up. My assumption is that the majority of their business is in take out and delivery.\n\nWhen trying a new Chinese restaurant the first things I order is egg rolls and hot and sour soup. If these basic items aren\'t good, then I think it is an indication of how the rest of their food will be. Luckily, the egg rolls were flavorful, crisp, hot and simply delicious! The hot and sour soup was exactly how it should be. I ordered it ""warm"" spiciness and found it to be very mild heat - next time for sure I will order it ""hot"" spiciness. For those of you who haven\'t tried this soup let me just say it is the sure cure for a cold. Its a little like comfort food.\n\nI have never tried Singapore Chow Mei Fun previously, anywhere, and was wowed by the wonderful flavors (slight curry) and the abundance of pork, chicken and shrimp in it. Fantastic choice. Next time I might order it chow Fun style, which has thicker flat noodles rather than the thin noodles. I also ordered this warm and found the spiciness level to be very nice for this dish.\n\nChicken with garlic sauce was better than your average with plenty of fresh broccoli and chicken done to perfection with the broccoli being tender crisp. Beef and broccoli also  better than average with the beef slices to be tender and flavorful.\n\nI will definitely come back to check out other dishes!

The ""hot pot"" was not hot pot as I know it from Sichuan province at all. It was basically bone in chicken wings. Flavor was decent, but deceptive on the menu. \n\nThe service was poor--they treated us very differently than the other customers -- plates of rice instead of bowls (who eats Chinese dishes with a plate?!), and acted like they\'d never heard of dishes I got in every city in China.

I thought it tasted good for chicken takeout! My friend also enjoy his sesame chicken. \n\nOne warning is that the waitress does not refill your water or check up on you. After 30 mins, the place started to get crowded with UMN students. I wasn't even finish eating my food and the waitress gave us our check!

I understand that different restaurants will do chow mein differently, but at most Chinese restaurants that I have been to, I have ordered it the same way, and they have typically came the same way. Our chow mein arrived and it was merely the chow mein noodles that are used to be a toppings on Asian-style salads, doused in a sauce and vegetables.

Second, I chose  Wonton Noodles in Soup $9.95 that is a basic Hong Kong food for checking their quality. Then I found that it was $1 difference with steamed chicken so that I ordered ""Steamed Chicken Wonton Noodles in Soup $10.95"". I was surprised  to see those wontons that I have never had because it was full of lean pork with about 0.05% of frozen cut shrimp. The ratio of pork and Shrimp was not traditional Wontons. In addition, the ratio for pork inside should be 30/70 fat and lean pork. The soup was not good. That was not the soup for Cantonese Wonton noodles. Tasted nothing. Glad that I got the ginger-scallion oil sauce for adding the flavor for finishing it. The Hong Kong milk tea was not strong enough but it was ok quality. \nThird, Overall their service was too slow. Took 20 minutes for a cup of milk tea and 15 minutes for noodles. \nFourth, their food was too expensive for this kind of quality.

One of my favorite items at Don's was their pressed duck. I have no idea how they did it but it was crispy on the outside and juicy and tender on the inside. My goodness that was good. No doubt Don's was kind of like my first crush. Over the years I have been to more Chinese places than I can remember.

Well that was enough for me to try it out. I had called in my order before I left work and drove over to pick it up. When I walked in the first thing I thought of was how much it resembled Don's. Mei Inn is pretty small. There are a handful of tables and a little cut out area for their register. A very nice man who was probably the owner came out to greet me. I gave him my name and he soon returned with a bag that was almost as big as he was and I'm sure pretty close to as heavy. Even though I had placed a large order, it was very affordable. Under $50.00 for 4 entree's and 4 appetizers with a side of fried rice. Big time bonus is he gave me a bag of almond cookies. Really?!?! I haven't seen almond cookies in years. That was so cool. Bonus points for Mei Inn! I was excited to get home to rip this bag open like it was Christmas. I had ordered egg rolls for my self because its the law that I get egg rolls at a Chinese restaurant. My wife would probably leave me if I didn't get cream cheese wantons so we had a order of those too. Then we added sweet and sour chicken and sesame chicken. My favorite item which is Chow Fun. OMG I love that dish. Lastly some chicken fried rice. The egg rolls were good, not great but good solid egg rolls. As much as I am not a cream cheese wanton fan, my arm was twisted enough to try one. Well actually two. These were really good. They were incredibly light if not lite and very crispy. I enjoyed these and would have risked getting stuck by the prongs of my wife's fork to try some more if not for wanting to save room for Chow Fun. My wife had all the chicken dishes that were also very good. The sauces were tasty and the chicken was lightly crispy and some good size pieces too. The Chow Fun was also very good. Not the best I have ever had but still very good. The best item by far were their dumplings. I ordered both steamed and fried as I don't discriminate when it comes to dumplings. These were so good, Besides being really good the best part was they filled their dumplings properly and didn't leave any wasted space. You know when you open a bag of chips and its only half full? That's like some places with their dumplings. You take a bite and there is an empty portion. Not at Mei Inn, these babies are packed and they are excellent! I really love this place and put Mei Inn at the top of my list. If I could give a 4.5 I would as it was really only the Chow Fun that wasn't great. That sure didn't keep me from finishing it though.

Orders would be accompanied by a handful of paper napkins, chop sticks that went unused and kept accumulating in a kitchen drawer until tossed out by my mother in a very occasional frenzy of decluttering, plastic packs of soy sauce, duck sauce and hot mustard that sometimes defied opening, and fortune cookies with all the flavor of lightly sweetened cardboard.  \n\nI would crave the Egg Foo Young from my youth that had the exact right texture and ingredients topped with that perfectly smooth, salty dark brown gravy. Fried rice just greasy enough to be sumptuous and generously flecked with chicken and veggies. Egg Rolls that were crispy, flaky and moist on the inside and stood up to generous swipes through a combination of duck sauce and mustard. \n\nI\'ve tried countless places all over the city of Minneapolis (in which there are approximately 3,497 Chinese takeout places give or take a few ;-) and traversed the vast expanse of western suburbs. Oh, maybe I\'d find one place that got the Egg Foo Young almost right. Another might offer a close match with their fried rice. \n\nBut until now, until I gave Mei Inn a try, nobody had managed to put it all together. To recreate the total package. To bring back blissful memories of eating a delightful meal accompanied by a huge glass of Iced Tea made from Lipton\'s powered tea mix (with an extra scoop to make it even more mind-alteringly sweet) all precariously set atop a metal folding TV tray as I watched The Wild, Wild West, McHale\'s Navy or The Man From U.N.C.L.E on a 20"" black and white Admiral television attached to foil wrapped rabbit ears.\n\nNow, when I\'m struck by an overwhelming, nostalgia driven need for the food I so thoroughly enjoyed as an 11 year old, Mei Inn can fill the bill. I can even order online thru my iPhone. As a preteen gadget freak I would have thought that was so cool. Actually, I think it\'s kind of cool now. Just sayin\'\n\nAnyway, this highly subjective review should be taken as such. Mei Inn may not transport you as it does me back to a simpler, happier time. Your quest unlike mine may not be at an end. To you I say farewell.
